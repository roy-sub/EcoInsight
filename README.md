Singapore has a new milestone of becoming a zero-waste nation and government is worried about the rising number of waste disposal over the past 40 years. At this pace, Semakau Landfill will run out of space by 2035 which is an alarming situation for Singaporeans. Making matters worse, Singapore has limited land for building new incineration plants or landfills. The government would like to motivate citizens by sharing the total energy that the combined recycling efforts have saved every year. They have asked you to help them.

# Introduction

In this case study, we aim to analyze waste collection and recycling rates in Singapore by integrating data from multiple sources. The primary datasets used for this analysis are the [Singapore NEA Energy Savings Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eminbasturk/singapore-nea-energy-savings) and the most recent [waste statistics and total recycling data](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/waste-statistics-and-overall-recycling) from the National Environment Agency (NEA) website. Additionally, we will utilize essential facts from [Greentumble](https://greentumble.com/how-does-recycling-save-energy) to determine the energy-saving potential through recycling.

# Steps

## 1. Data Extraction
We will start by extracting relevant data from the Kaggle dataset, which includes information on energy savings in Singapore. This dataset likely covers a range of environmental factors, including waste management.

## 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Cleaning and preparing the data is crucial for meaningful analysis. We will address missing values, standardize formats, and ensure consistency across datasets.

## 3. Analysis of Waste Collection and Recycling Rates
Using the cleaned data, we will analyze the overall waste collection and recycling rates in Singapore. This will provide insights into the effectiveness of current waste management practices.

## 4. Integration of Recent Waste Statistics
To enhance the analysis, we will incorporate the most recent waste statistics and total recycling data from the NEA website. This ensures that our findings are based on the latest available information.

## 5. Determining Energy Savings through Recycling
By referencing essential facts from Greentumble, we will estimate the amount of energy that can be saved through recycling. This information will shed light on the environmental benefits of recycling efforts in Singapore.

## 6. Tableau Dashboard Creation
To make the analysis easily understandable, we will create a user-friendly report or dashboard using Tableau. This will visually represent key findings and trends, providing stakeholders with a clear overview of waste management and recycling in Singapore.

# Conclusion

Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to provide valuable insights into Singapore's waste management practices, recycling rates, and the associated energy-saving benefits. The Tableau dashboard will serve as a user-friendly tool for stakeholders to grasp the findings effectively and make informed decisions regarding environmental sustainability.
